# Street Fighter 6 Quick Reference
Web app to display basic Street Fighter 6 character move data in a simple format.

[Click here for the current live version of the tool](https://jerp.tv/streetfighter6).  A shorter url is available [here](https://jerp.tv/sf6).

## How to Use:

1. Select your desired character.
2. The selected character's moves will be displayed in a way that should (eventually) fit a single screen.

## To-Do:
* Finish work to have the app fit on a single screen on various devices (including mobile).
* Add toggle for Modern controls.
* Half-drive-meter and >> fast forward icon for drive parry.

## Credits
* Thanks to [Malastrome](https://twitter.com/malastrome) for transcribing a bunch of move data from the Command List screens posted by various YouTubers.  Also excellent if you need an editor for your videos.
* Thanks to [Woolie](https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz) for posting the Command List screens for the non-beta characters.
* Thanks to [Rooflemonger](https://twitter.com/Rooflemonger) for posting the [Guile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjWuRgPy1NI), [Juri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbzOeLEst2U), and [Ken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM4wzD1KtRI) move lists.
* Thanks to the [FAT](https://fullmeter.com/fat) devs for making their much-more-detailed move data available.  I didn't end up using it for this project (turned out to to be easier to manually transcribe the Command List screens in-game), but the tool and frame data are fantastic for advanced players.
