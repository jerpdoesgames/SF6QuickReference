# Street Fighter 6 Quick Reference
Web app to display basic Street Fighter 6 character move data in a simple format.

[Click here for the current live version of the tool](https://jerp.tv/streetfighter6).  A shorter url is available [here](https://jerp.tv/sf6).

## How to Use:

1. Select your desired character.
2. The selected character's moves will be displayed in a way that should (eventually) fit a single screen.

## To-Do:
* Fix bugs / typos - I've already fixed a few (let me know if you find any more).
* If the Steam beta ends up allowing browser windows with transparency overlaid on top of games, I want to make an update to support that (maybe allow selecting the choice moves you want to pin, etc.)
* I'll probably make some changes to how everything resizes to be a little cleaner / better use available space.
* People were asking about displaying frame data - but I think that may be best left to FAT/SuperCombo. Though I could work something out if there's enough interest.
* Half-drive-meter for parry drive rush.

## Credits
* Thanks to [Malastrome](https://twitter.com/malastrome) for transcribing a bunch of move data from the Command List screens posted by various YouTubers.  Also excellent if you need an editor for your videos.
* Thanks to [Woolie](https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz) for posting the Command List screens for the non-beta characters.
* Thanks to [Rooflemonger](https://twitter.com/Rooflemonger) for posting the [Guile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjWuRgPy1NI), [Juri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbzOeLEst2U), and [Ken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM4wzD1KtRI) move lists.
* Thanks to the [FAT](https://fullmeter.com/fat) devs for making their much-more-detailed move data available.  I didn't end up using it for this project (turned out to to be easier to manually transcribe the Command List screens in-game), but the tool and frame data are fantastic for advanced players.
